\chapter*{Research Aims}
%Object detection and classification are fundamental problems of both Augmented Reality (AR) and computer vision.
This thesis aims to detect geometric primitives, such as planes, spheres, and cylinders,
within three-dimensional data obtained from mobile devices.
The primary objective is to generate a 3D model of an interior space, which encompasses furniture and other objects.
An additional (optional) objective may involve the detection and categorization of these objects.
Depth information from the Google ARCore SDK, which does not require specialized depth-sensing hardware, will be used.

\subsection*{Areas of Research}
Augmented Reality, Surface Reconstruction, Point Clouds, Depth Maps, Primitive Extraction, Object representation, Object Detection, Mobile Applications


\subsection*{Possible Extensions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Detection and classification of objects within the scene
    \item Session Management: Implement functionality to save the extracted data, enabling users to pause and later resume the session, ensuring object identifiers are maintained across sessions
    \item Object Persistence: Extend the system to recognize and track objects even when they are moved between sessions
\end{enumerate}
