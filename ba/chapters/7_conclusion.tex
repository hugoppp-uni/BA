\section{Future Work}

The system developed in this thesis provides a foundation for further research and development in
the field of processing depth data from ARCore or similar APIs that provide a sequence of depth images, to create a mesh of a scene.
However, the biggest current limitation of the system is the quality of the depth data, as the depth-from-motion technique
used by ARCore has limitations when it comes to detecting depth in objects with minimal texture.

An interesting aspect for further research is thus exploring the data quality of different devices,
with and without depth sensors, and how it affects the performance of the primitive detection algorithm.
Using the Full Depth API instead of the Raw Depth API and testing if the interpolated depth data improves the results
is also a valid point of further research.

As far as extending the system, implementing the detection of more complex primitives,
such as cylinders and spheres, would be a logical next step.
The part of detecting the actual primitives also provides a good starting point for further research,
as there exist many different algorithms, specialized for different types of contexts and applications, as discussed in chapter~\ref{ch:primitive-detection-algorithms}.
As the system provides the foundation for building the point cloud and rendering the primitives,
it is possible to exchange the primitive detection algorithm with a different one, without changing other parts of the system
and evaluate the performance of different algorithms for the specific use case.

Solving the problem of data quality also opens up many new research possibilities,
such as classifying and / or labeling the objects in the scene or implementing a system
that allows for objects to be moved during a session.
