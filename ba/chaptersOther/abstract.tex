%This thesis introduces a system for detecting primitives in a point cloud generated
%from depth data obtained from a smartphone lacking specialized depth sensing hardware, using the Google ARCore API\@.
%The system utilizes a custom octree implementation to efficiently store and update the point cloud information in real time.
%The RANSAC implementation by~\cite{schnabel_efficient_2007}, is employed to detect primitives in the point cloud.
%The resulting primitive parameterizations are then used to construct a triangle mesh of the convex hull of the primitives,
%which is finally overlaid on the camera feed.

This thesis presents a system that detects geometric primitive in the user's surroundings on mobile devices without specialized depth-sensing hardware.
The system utilizes depth data from the Google ARCore Depth API to create a point cloud.
To efficiently store and update the point cloud information in real-time, a custom octree implementation is employed.
Primitives are detected within the point cloud using the RANSAC implementation by~\cite{schnabel_efficient_2007}.
The resulting parameterizations of the primitives are used to generate triangle meshes of their convex hulls.
These meshes are finally rendered and overlayed onto the camera feed, accessible to the user through an
Augmented Reality (AR) application.



%This thesis aims to detect geometric primitives, such as planes, spheres, and cylinders,
%within three-dimensional data obtained from mobile devices.
%The primary objective is to generate a 3D mesh of an interior space, which encompasses furniture and other objects.
%An additional (optional) objective may involve the detection and categorization of these objects.
%Depth information from the Google ARCore SDK, which does not require specialized depth-sensing hardware, will be used.

%The aim of this thesis is to provide an end-to-end implementation of a system
%that can detect primitives on a mobile device using data from the Google ARCore Depth API
%and render a mesh of the detected primitives overlaid onto the camera feed.
