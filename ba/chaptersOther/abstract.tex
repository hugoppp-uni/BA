\section*{Abstract}
This thesis aims to detect geometric primitives, such as planes, spheres, and cylinders,
within three-dimensional data obtained from mobile devices.
The primary objective is to generate a 3D model of an interior space, which encompasses furniture and other objects.
An additional (optional) objective may involve the detection and categorization of these objects.
Depth information from the Google ARCore SDK, which does not require specialized depth-sensing hardware, will be used.

\section*{Summary}

The aim of this thesis is to provide an end-to-end implementation of a system
that can detect primitives on a mobile device using data from the Google ARCore Depth API
and render a mesh of the detected primitives overlaid onto the camera feed.
